This will be a high-res (256x256x256) texture pack for Minetest.
Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0)

The textures within this pack all started somewhere - Either my camera or online downloaded sites, some of which do not allow commercial use.
Except once a few years ago this pack was never re-released for all the following updates to MC. I up sized and re-done them over the years for personal use only. Family and close friends.
99% of the images have been edited to make them work and look the best I can for your use. There is the odd one or three that are straight download, resize and rename, but not many and only because they are more or less perfect as they are. The default_grass is a good example. I still had to rework it for the default_grass_side though.

Because this is a straight conversion and I haven't worked them yet, and for those textures that don't exist in the original texture pack I had to create a few on the fly. It is obvious that this WIP still has some way to go. You will surely notice the errors. I have! I will continually work on this and get things right for you. This is just a straight upload , as is for now.

Please, enjoy them for what they are so far and Please be kind and patient.

Feel free to contact me in the forums, if you see any errors I miss along the way or have any suggestions for the following textures you may want seen.
