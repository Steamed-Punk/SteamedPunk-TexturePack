# Steamed_Punk Texture Pack

![Image description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Steamed-Punk/SteamedPunk-TexturePack/master/screenshot.png?token=ANDKMR4RNNHZE3FLBSRPMPK5OUV3U)

This is a high-res (256x256x256) texture pack for Minetest.
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)

The textures within this pack all started somewhere - Either my camera or online download sites.
Except once a few years ago this pack was never re-released for all the following updates to MC. I up sized and worked them over the years for personal use only. Family and close friends.
99% of the images have been edited to make them work and look the best I can for your use. There is the odd one or three that are a straight download, resize and rename, but not many and only because they are more or less perfect as they are. The default_grass is a good example. I still had to rework it for the default_grass_side though.

Please, enjoy them for what they are and Please be kind.

Feel free to contact me in the forums, if you see any errors I may have missed or have any suggestions for the following textures you may want seen.
